# Introduction to Tools Exercises

For the first exercise that you complete you will be following the [Save Your Code Revisions Forever with Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/save-your-code-revisions-forever-with-git) curriculum on freeCodeCamp.

This curriculum will give you a crash course and get you familiar with many of the Git fundamentals along with the Git workflow. You will work within an environment called Cloud9 to complete this tutorial. In order to use Cloud9 you will need to provide a credit card (don't worry the service is free). This is to eliminate the bots and abusers who take advantage of this service to launch sophisticated technical attacks.

**Proof** After you complete the exercise, create a file *index.txt* here in your m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools folder and paste your Github username into it. **Make sure to `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push origin` your changes so that they are uploaded to BitBucket.**
